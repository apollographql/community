Welcome! The Apollo community is made up of developers around the world who are building awesome things with GraphQL. The project is sponsored by [Meteor Development Group](http://www.meteor.com), where many of Apollo’s core contributors work.

In this section, you can learn how to get help with Apollo and GraphQL, contribute to Apollo projects, and attend events and talks organized by the community.

## Join the Community

Come chat with Apollo team members, contributors, and developers on [our Slack](http://www.apollodata.com/#slack). It’s a great place to get help using Apollo and discuss the latest in the GraphQL community.

To keep up to date on all things Apollo, you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apollographql), [Medium](https://medium.com/apollo-stack), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/apollographql/).

## Contribute to Apollo

The Apollo project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql), and is made up of a diverse set of tools for implementing GraphQL, written and maintained by [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/apollographql/people) around the world. We’d love your help!

Here are some ways you can get involved with the project:

- Report an issue
- Submit a pull request
- Update or write documentation
- Write a blog post
- Give a conference talk
- Organize a meetup
