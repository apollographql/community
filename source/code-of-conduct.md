title: Apollo Code of Conduct
order: 10
---
### Community and Diversity

We want to build a productive, happy and agile community that welcomes new ideas, constantly looks for areas to improve, and fosters collaboration. 

The project gains strength from a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in our contributor community, and we actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to lay some ground rules that ensure we can collaborate and communicate effectively, despite our diversity. The code applies equally to founders, team members and those seeking help and guidance.

### Using This Code

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, it’s a guide for participation in the community that outlines how each of us can work to keep Apollo a positive, successful, and growing project. 

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Apollo project or company. This includes Spectrum, GitHub issues, the GraphQL Summit and GraphQL SF events, and any other forums created by the Apollo team which the community uses for communication. Breaches of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. We expect it to be honored by everyone who represents or participates in the project, whether officially or informally.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report it by emailing [codeofconduct@graphql.com](mailto:codeofconduct@graphql.com). 

### We Strive To:

- **Be open, patient, and welcoming**

    Members of this community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PRs, issues, or problems. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as we value what the experiences and skill sets of contributors bring to the project. We're accepting of all who wish to get involved, and find ways for anyone to participate in a way that best matches their strengths.
  
- **Be considerate**

    We are considerate of our peers: other Apollo users and contributors. We’re thoughtful when addressing others’ efforts, keeping in mind that work is often undertaken for the benefit of the community. We also value others’ time and appreciate that not every issue or comment will be responded to immediately. We strive to be mindful in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching views that are different from our own.
    
- **Be respectful**

    As a community of professionals, we are professional in our handling of disagreements, and don’t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. 

    We do not tolerate harassment or exclusionary behavior. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or sexualized content.
  - Posting content depicting or encouraging violence. 
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
  
- **Take responsibility for our words and our actions**

    We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully. We are also considerate of others’ attempts to amend their mistakes.
    
- **Be collaborative**  

    The work we produce is (and is part of) an ecosystem containing several parallel efforts working towards a similar goal. Collaboration between teams and individuals that each have their own goal and vision is essential to reduce redundancy and improve the quality of our work. 
    
    Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.
    
- **Ask for help when in doubt**

    Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.
    
- **Take initiative** 

    We encourage new participants to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment when they feel innovation could improve the project. If we have an idea for a new tool, or how an existing tool can be improved, we speak up and take ownership of that work when possible.

## GraphQL Summit

*Revision: October 2019*

All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, contractors, and volunteers at GraphQL Summit are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the conference, on social media, and at any related workshops and social events.

### Summary

Apollo GraphQL and GraphQL Summit are committed to providing a fulfilling, inclusive, and harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form; nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably make another feel unsafe, insecure, unwelcome, or scared for their well-being. 

### What the Code means

Harassing behavior includes any of the following: 

* offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* sexual images in public spaces
* deliberate intimidation, stalking, following
* harassing photography or recording
* sustained disruption of talks or other events
* inappropriate physical contact, and 
* unwelcome sexual attention.

Anyone asked to stop any harassing behavior is expected to comply immediately.

Behave professionally. Be respectful of different viewpoints or experiences. Use inclusive language. Sexual language or imagery isn’t acceptable at GraphQL Summit, including any talks.

Concerning the costume party during GraphQL Summit, all attendees should start from a place of mutual respect and understanding. An inappropriate costume is one in which someone of a culture takes elements from another culture.

Anyone violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from GraphQL Summit without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Your attendance is important to us and we’d like you to have an enjoyable time connecting and collaborating with fellow GraphQL community members, leaders, and supporters.

### Reporting an incident

If you are being harassed, or notice that someone is being harassed, please reach out to the organizers by any of the following means:

* **Anonymously** at this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/9fu3qJXBRJSpqE9M9). We cannot directly follow-up an anonymous report, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.
* **Email** at [codeofconduct@graphql.com](mailto:codeofconduct@graphql.com)
* **SMS** at 1-925-338-9934
* **In-person report** with an Apollo team member (identified by a purple GraphQL Summit 2019 t-shirt)

When taking a personal report, our team will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other team members to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.

During the hours of GraphQL Summit, we’ll get in touch within 1 hour. Outside the hours of GraphQL Summit, we’ll be in touch within 8 hours.
